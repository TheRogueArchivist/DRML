## Overall Description:

Copy-X was a ring-based copy protection scheme from german company optimal media[^CopyX_Original_Website]. As seen in Names, four different types seem to have been in use[^CopyX_Original_Website]. Note that it has not yet been confirmed whether light and professional correspond to the currently established distinct behaviors, but it seems to be the most likely conclusion.
Had to be mastered at a specific optimal media production plant[^CopyX_2009_Document].

##### copy-X light:

This behavior has been tested, but it is still unconfirmed if it specifically corresponds to copy-X light. 
Basic ring protection via dummy files intersected[^Dummy_Confirmation] by rings. No software protection is used unless otherwise supplied by the game itself[^84759]. Can be circumvented by simply not copying the dummy files when copying the rest of the game from the disc.

[^Dummy_Confirmation]: Confirmed via checking dummy files in a hex editor. These dummy files are always intersected by rings (0x55 on redump-images, varies on others depending on what the dumping program does with those errors).

##### copy-X professional:

This behavior has been tested, but it is still unconfirmed if it specifically corresponds to copy-X professional.
Builds upon copy-X light. Contains everything described there, but also adds software protection in the form of a disc check, which appears to additionally check one of the dummy files. Copy-X professional also checks if the kernel debugging software SoftICE is active via a process called SoftICE-Test, checking both for "SoftICE for Windows 95" and for "SoftICE for Windows NT", ending game execution if detected when booting the game. This seems to be the only debugger protected against, likely due to the popularity of this debugger at the time.

#### Untested:

* copy-X audio
* copy-X trial maker

##### copy-X audio:

No samples have been tested at the moment, so exact specifics cannot be confirmed. Used to protect Audio CDs.

##### copy-X trial maker:

No samples currently known, and thus no information either.

## Supported Platforms:

* copy-X light: Any (no software protection is employed, although it appears to mainly be marketed for Windows games regardless.)

* copy-X professional: Windows
(Some professional games are Hybrid PC/Mac discs, but the Mac versions of these games do not appear to utilize any sort of software protection.)[^108150]

* copy-X audio: Audio CD

***

## Software Known to Detect:

* ProtectionID[^PiD_List] (Note: While ProtectionID does detect copy-X, it detects it as "Optgraph Copy-X / Ring-Protech". As far as current research has found, there is no relation between copy-X and Ring Protech other than both being ring-based protections, and the optgraph file in question is not found on Ring Protech. PiD is thus believed to be incorrect in designating it also Ring-Protech, and it's just detecting Copy-X in these instances.)
* BinaryObjectScanner[^BoS_File]

[^BoS_File]: [BinaryObjectScanner code file in charge of detecting Copy-X](https://github.com/SabreTools/BinaryObjectScanner/blob/master/BinaryObjectScanner/Protection/CopyX.cs)

[^PiD_List]: [Old PiD website link listing PC ISO protections](https://web.archive.org/web/20090830061942/http://pid.gamecopyworld.com/)

***

## Preservation Instructions:

The ring protection present on all copy-X discs will cause errors during dumping. This will not cause issues with the playability of the final image, but may make it difficult or slow to copy/rip data, and makes it very difficult to guarantee you've gotten a 1:1 rip of all data on the disc.

copy-X light: None. Copying all files from the disc besides the dummy data directory is sufficient to defeat the protection.

copy-X professional: Any sort of basic copy of the disc image appears to work. An ISO of the game will function, as will Bin/Cue or other similar formats if the game has audio tracks.

## Associated File Attributes:

### File Directories:

#### "System":
Directory for dummy files used by most professional[^48393][^DE_EM2DX] discs so far, as well as some light[^Kenny] discs.

#### "ZDAT"/"zdata":
ZDAT is the directory for dummy files used by some[^84759][^107929][^81628][^101786], but not all[^Kenny] light discs, and two known professional[^Petterson] disc so far. One calls it zdata[^108150], one calls it ZDATA[^108150], and one uses System[^Kenny] instead. Further variance likely.

### File Names:

Note: file names are not case sensitive, and vary from disc to disc.

#### "[m/g]ov_*.x64":
Dummy file associated with professional. Names include gov_io.x64[^108150][^Petterson], gov_05.x64[^48393][^DE_EM2DX], and mov_io.x64.

#### "iofile.x64"[^48393][^DE_EM2DX][^108150][^Petterson]:
Dummy file associated with professional. Seems to be directly referenced by optgraph.dll.

#### "sound.x64"[^48393][^108150][^Petterson]:
Dummy file associated with professional. Seemingly not present on at least one[^DE_EM2DX] professional disc.

#### "optgraph.dll"[^DE_EM2DX][^48393][^108150][^Petterson]:
Dll file responsible for software protection on professional discs.
